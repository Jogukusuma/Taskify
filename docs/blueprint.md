- Accent color: Soft green (#A5D6A7) to indicate task completion.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for readability and a modern feel.
- Use simple, recognizable icons for task categories and actions (e.g., pencil for edit, checkmark for complete).

- Subtle animations to confirm task completion and indicate changes in task status.
